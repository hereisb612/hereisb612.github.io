> can change a normal directory into a git repository.

1. cd into this directory

2. use ```git init``` command in terminal

3. Then a .git file will be create, which means this directory becomes to a git repository

   *if a project download from Github as .zip and you unarcheve this .zip, at this time, it is only a normal directory, and you need to use ```git init``` command to change it to a git repo.*
