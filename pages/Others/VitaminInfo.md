# Vitamin A

Having an average of 1.5mg a day or less of vitamin A from diet and supplements combined is unlikely to cause any harm.

# B vitamins

- thiamin (vitamin B1)
- riboflavin (vitamin B2)
- niacin (vitamin B3) 
- pantothenic acid
- vitamin B6
- biotin (vitamin B7) 
- folate and folic acid
- vitamin B12
## B1

Taking 100mg or less a day of thiamin supplements is unlikely to cause any harm.

## B2

Taking 40mg or less a day of riboflavin supplements is unlikely to cause any harm.

## B3

Taking 17mg or less of nicotinic acid supplements a day, or 500mg or less of nicotinamide supplements a day, is unlikely to cause any harm.

## Pantothenic acid

Taking 200mg or less a day of pantothenic acid in supplements is unlikely to cause any harm.

## B6

The effect of taking vitamin B6 at doses between 10 and 200 mg is unclear. So there's not enough evidence to say how long these doses could be taken for safely.

Do not take more than 10mg of vitamin B6 a day in supplements unless advised to by a doctor.

## Folate and folic acid

Taking 1mg or less a day of folic acid supplements is unlikely to cause any harm.

## B12

Taking 2mg or less a day of vitamin B12 in supplements is unlikely to cause any harm.

# Vitamin C

Taking less than 1,000mg of vitamin C supplements a day is unlikely to cause any harm.

# Vitamin D

> Sometimes the amount of vitamin D is expressed as International Units (IU). 
> 1 microgram of vitamin D is equal to 40 IU. 
> So **10 micrograms of vitamin D is equal to 400 IU.**

The Department of Health and Social Care recommends that adults and children over 4 take a daily supplement containing **10 micrograms of vitamin D** throughout the year if they: are not often outdoors – for example, if they're frail or housebound.

**If you choose to take vitamin D supplements, 10 micrograms a day will be enough for most people.**

**Do not take more than 100 micrograms (4,000 IU)** of vitamin D a day as it could be harmful. This applies to adults, including pregnant and breastfeeding women and the elderly, and children aged 11 to 17 years.

# Calcium

Taking 1,500mg or less a day is unlikely to cause any harm.
